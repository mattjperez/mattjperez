### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a former network engineer in the US Marines and (after a windy road) am studying computer science and learning spanish while living in MedellÃ­n, Colombia. I lived in Tokyo for a number of years where I studied international business and enjoyed some of the best food on earth. Whether it's food, culture, martial arts, lifting, scuba diving, or salsa dancing, we could probably talk for quite a while ðŸ˜„. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently taking courses from Harvard Extension School on Data Structures and Systems Programming, (Operating Systems in the Spring). While I'm not able to post them publically, some of the work I've done recently includes: creating a custom malloc interface, defusing binary bombs, virtual memory management for kernel and processes, reimplement stio cache, add piping and redirection functionality to shell, and fix synchronization issues in a network pong game.
- ðŸŒ± I started learning Rust a few months ago and would like to collaborate on projects where I can use and learn more about it. It was a big leap for me going from python to Rust, but in doing so I learned about a lot of things that are now primary areas of interest to me, namely systems level programming.

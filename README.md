### Hi there 👋

Hello! I'm currently working as a software engineer at Asimetrix, an IoT and analytics company based in Medellín, Colombia. I'm also an incoming grad student at Georgia Tech's online computer science program.

Before that, I was a network engineer in the US Marines, a business student in Tokyo, an investment analyst, and even had an e-commerce project. The data analytics of that project started a windy road that eventually led me to software engineering.

For work I mainly use Python, however Rust is my language of choice. I'm also familiar with C, Javascript, and Java.

While my pandemic hobby has become attending virtual Rust meetups, I also enjoy lifting weights, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, scuba diving, and cabalgatas (riding horses in the mountains).

I like discussing software, business, and finance. My international business background and budding tech career lets me appreciate everything from the business model and market fit to technical implementations.

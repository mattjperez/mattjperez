### Hi there 👋

I'm a former network engineer in the US Marines and (after a windy road) am studying computer science and learning spanish while living in Medellín, Colombia. I lived in Tokyo for a number of years where I studied international business and enjoyed some of the best food on earth. Whether it's food, culture, martial arts, lifting, scuba diving, or salsa dancing, we could probably talk for quite a while 😄. 

- 🔭 I’m currently taking courses from Harvard Extension School on Data Structures and Systems Programming. While I'm not able to post them publically, some of the work I've done recently includes: creating a custom malloc interface, defusing binary bombs, virtual memory management for kernel and processes. 
- 🌱 I started learning Rust a few months ago and would like to collaborate on projects where I can use and learn more about it. It was a big leap for me going from python to Rust, but in doing so I learned about a lot of things that are now primary areas of interest to me, namely systems programming.

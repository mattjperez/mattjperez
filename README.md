### Hi there 👋

Hello! I'm Matt, a software engineer and graduate student at Georgia Tech's online computer science program.

Before learning to code, I was a network engineer in the US Marines, a business student in Tokyo, an investment analyst, and even had an e-commerce project. The data analytics of that project started a windy road that eventually led me to software engineering.

For programming, I prefer Rust and Python, however I'm also familiar with C and Typescript.

I enjoy lifting weights, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, scuba diving, and cabalgatas (riding horses in the mountains).

I like discussing software, business, and finance. My international business background and budding tech career lets me appreciate everything from the business model and market fit to technical implementations.
